Configuration
===
I'd like to think of these classes as the `@Bean` functions/classes. It's basically the things that 
initialize and create the classes that run the 3rd party databases or servers for you. (Mainly database for now)

It is important to put the `@Configuration` annotation if you want to use the `@Bean` tag.
