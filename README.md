Notes
===

This will be the place where I write down what I learn and hated or whatever about SpringBoot so that I can put it on my resume after wards and get a JOB UWU HELP ME PLEASE!

So when you start a SpringBoot project as a web project, you need to have (all same versions of courses or the latest):
- spring-starter-web
- spring-web

Spring-Web 
===
This one gives you the annotations to help build the web.

Spring-Starter-Web
===
This one gives you the functions that the annotations will use to start the web, I'm guessing.
